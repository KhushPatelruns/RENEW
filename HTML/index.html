  <p> CV RENEW is a student-run organization committed to advancing our understanding and application of renewable energy solutions to create a more sustainable future. In building an eco- and socially friendly environment, we strive to not only educate others on a lasting future but also explore and educate ourselves in the process. Through in-depth discussions and hands-on community service projects, we aim to learn by making tangible contributions to our district. We strive to inspire action and innovation in our future endeavors by promoting sustainable practices and energy awareness.
