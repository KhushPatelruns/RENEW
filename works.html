 <div class="img-info"> <h3> Cardboard Shredding Event</h3>
  <img class="lead" src="img/SHREDDING.jpg">
  <p> Our first project was with State Representative Sheryl Delozier. Using a solar powered shreddar, we collected about 5 full bags of shredded cardboard. This cardboard was then donated to the Shaull Elementary Garden to be used as compost.</p>

  <img class="lead" src="img/Weed.jpg">
    <p> Our second project led us back to the Shaull garden. The club prepared the beds for the upcoming school year by pulling the overgrowth of weeds! We also took measurements for a future proposal of a solar-powered drip irrigation system to be built at the garden. This would effectively minimize the human labor and costs associated with maintaining the garden.</p>

 <div class="img-info"> <h3>Harrisburg University Aqua+Hydroponics and Agricultural Tour</h3>
  <img class="lead" src="img/HU.jpg">
    <p>The CV RENEW Club had an incredible experience touring Harrisburg University's greenhouse and diving into the future of sustainable technology.

      We learned about aquaponic and hydroponic systems, powered entirely by acres of solar panels, which also support the entire Steelton School District as well as its fleet of buses. 
      
      Beyond Earth, we were amazed to discover that NASA sponsors HU’s research, exploring aquaponics as a “near-reusable” solution for creating food in space. Instead of sending thousands of pounds of food, aquaponic systems can sustain long-term missions by recycling fish waste as nutrients for plants—an economic and sustainable breakthrough!
      
      Thank you to Harrisburg University of Science and Technology’s, Rachel Fogle, Joe Tetreault, and Bradlee Metzger for hosting us and sharing your expertise. This opportunity inspired us to think bigger about sustainability and innovation, and we’re so grateful for the experience!
