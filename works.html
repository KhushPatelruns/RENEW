  <img class="banner" src="img/SHREDDING.jpg">
  <p> Our first project was with State Representative Sheryl Delozier. Using a solar powered shreddar, we collected about 5 full bags of shredded cardboard. This cardboard was then donated to the Shaull Elementary Garden to be used as compost.</p>

  <img class="banner" src="img/Weed.jpg">
    <p> Our second project led us back to the Shaull garden. The club prepared the beds for the upcoming school year by pulling the overgrowth of weeds! We also took measurements for a future proposal of a solar-powered drip irrigation system to be built at the garden. This would effectively minimize the human labor and costs associated with maintaining the garden.</p>
