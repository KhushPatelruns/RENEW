    <div class="img-info"><h3> The Energy Crisis</h3>
    <p> In the simplist way to put it, the energy crisis reflects the global energy shortage. As a result, the cost of daily living has been on the rise and has been experienced first-hand by several countries around the globe. </p>
    <p> The stem of this global challenge comes from the dependence on fossil fuels as a primary energy source and the underfunded research into renewable energy sources. To further add, the pandemic of COVID 19 further amplified the situation with the halt in transportation and energy usage, resulting in lower demand cycling into lower supply. As per politics, sanctions between primary oil and coal lines in Europe has skyrocketed prices and obstructed the industry. The high prices are only paving the way for another global recession.</p>
    <div class="img-info"><h3> Our Power</h3></div>
